What did we talk about last time?

## Last time...

::: {.incremental}

- Growth (change) and income (level): key for living standards

- Starting from simple Solow-Swan: critical role played by...

    - K (capital), L (labor), A (technology)

    - Steady state: no growth

    - Only tech can maintain growth

- Growth can come from (Mokyr 1990):

    - Capital accumulation (_Solovian growth_)

    - Scale (pop) (Boserup)

    - Technological innovation (_Schumpetarian growth_)

    - Market expansion (_Smithian growth_)

- First part of the semester: politics of K, L, A

- Second part of the semester: study of markets, institutions

## This week: history

- Key role played by history

- Impossible to understand growth, income, wealth w/o historical context

- Two critical periods: 

    1. Neolithic (stone) age (~12,000 BCE)

    2. Industrial revolution

## Context

- Living standards: no clear trend 0-1600ish

- Does **not** mean absence of innovations

    - Eg glass, paper, printing press, compass, etc.

- Does **not** mean stability

    - Eg decline after ~600, Black Death, etc.

- Thus: ups and downs

- Until...

## Industrial revolution

- 1st IR: UK, 1760s until early 1800s

- Dramatic change in technology (steam engine) and society

- Dramatic impact on growth and income

- Long-term effects (cor GDP 1900, 2010: $\rho=0.66$)

    names_prefix = "gdppc")

#d2 = d2[complete.cases(d2),]
#cor(d2$gdppc1900, d2$gdppc2010)

```

::: {.incremental}

- Many competing theories for IR

    - Push: excess labor exiting agriculture (proletariat)

    - Pull: new technology and decline in prod costs

- Where did the "pull" come from? Hypotheses...

- Demand: strong demand for consumer goods (London)

- Supply and demand: capital from colonies (limited evidence)

- Supply: a "culture of growth" that helped tech innovations(Enlightenment; Mokyr)

- Lot of great work: Joel Mokyr, Robert Allen, Deirdre McCloskey, etc.

:::

##

- Key insight: effects are **persistent** 

- Clear when looking at correlation of GDP over time

- New: could _effects_ from 1700s (say) have _consequences_ today?

- In polisci: path dependency (Pierson 2000)

- Literature on long-term determinants of growth

- Often criticized

    - Theory. Mechanisms? 

    - Empirics (eg Kelly 2019, Guinanne 2022)

## Sidenote

::: {.incremental}

- Raises the prob of definition of causal effects. Neyman (1923), Rubin (1974), Holland (1986)

- Potential outcomes: $Y^0$, $Y^1$ for $D\in\{0,1\}$

- Unit treatment effect: $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$

- Fundamental problem of causal inference

- If $Y^0, Y^1 \perp \!\!\! \perp D$: can estimate ATE$=E[Y^1]-E[Y^0]$

- Danger: confounders, selection, baseline

- Two approaches to do so: design- and model-based inference

- $Y^0, Y^1 \perp \!\!\! \perp D | \mathbf{X}$ $\rightarrow$ CATE$=E[Y^1 | \mathbf{X}]-E[Y^0 | \mathbf{X}]$

:::

##

- Anyway...

- Problem here: can one generate a plausible counterfactual?

- Example: Fogel and railroads (1964)

- Need to think very carefully about...

    - Theory (mechanisms)

    - Source of variation in treatment

    - Alternative causal paths
