## Research: where to start...

::: {.incremental}

- Always a challenge...

- One approach: \textbf{gap} in the literature

- Idea: people have looked at...

    - $X \rightarrow Y$

    - $Z \rightarrow Y$

    - What about $X \rightarrow Z$?

- Not very compelling

- Instead: focus on **expanding** research rather than filling gaps

:::

##

::: {.incremental}

More compelling...

- **Interesting** treatments

    - Can come from other disciplines

    - Eg: social capital

- **Important** outcomes

    - People care about it!

- Spell out **mechanisms**

- Ask a yes/no question

:::

##

::: {.incremental}

- Typically: contribution comes from...

- New theory

    - Democratic peace

- New data

    - Military recruitment early 1800s

- New empirical strategy

    - How can we measure political ideology?

- (Almost) never all three... but at least one!

:::

## Theory

::: {.incremental}

- Many ways to proceed. Here's mine.

- Step 1: use a decision/game-theoretic approach:

    1. Players: who matters? (**unit of analysis**)

    2. Strategies: what can players do?

    3. Payoffs: what are their preferences?

- Step 2: generate comparative statics

    - When pref change, what happens to strategies?

    - Note: you want observables on both!

- Does not preclude more complicated approaches (beliefs, culture, networks, etc.)

:::

##

::: {.incremental}

- Sharpen your research question (yes/no)

- Make sure that the outcome is important, or

- Make sure the treatment is interesting, or

- Make sure your data/empirical strategy are innovative

- Use building blocks (players, strategies, payoffs) to build your argument
